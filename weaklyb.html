    <p>
        
        This week in Internet Art, I learned how to add elements to a webpage. 
        I learned how to declare classes in HTML and refer to their CSS file.
        I also learned the difference was to use the div tag and how to declare a class from within. 
        Within in CSS file, I learned how to make boxes around the text of different sizes and with different boards.
       
       
        I am interested in learning more about how CSS and HTML files work together to create a webpage.
        Unfortunately, I was out sick Wednesday and Friday of this week.
        I am looking forward to building my webpage shortly.
        I have been enjoying learning HTML and CSS when my other courses focus on C and C#.

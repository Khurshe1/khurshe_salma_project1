        I submitted exercise 3 this week in Internet Art. 
        Exercise 3 entailed creating a proposal for your upcoming Project 1. 
        I intend to have my Project 1 consist of various shapes of different sizes that once clicked on will send you to different parts of the website. 
        I am looking forward to seeing what my Project 1 will look like!

        During class, I had time to work on my Project 1. 
        I was able to implement code so that once a triangle was clicked you were sent to a separate html file. 
        I am going to continue making different shapes that lead to different files. 
        I hope to get the shapes to move around on the screen as well!

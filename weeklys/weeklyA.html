    <h2>Weekly A </h2> 
    <h6> 1/24/2023</h6>

    <p>
        This week in Internet Art, we continued learning HTML. 
        I learned how to use new tags that allow me to attach a photo, include links, and change the color of the text.
        I discovered how to change each color in a list individually rather than the whole list. 
        I also learned how to set up a basic HTML file.
        
        I struggled with being able to update my GitHub with changes made in Visual Studio Code.
        However, I was soon able to figure out how to push to my repository!
        I was able to provide a link to my repository for Exercise 0. 
        I am looking forward to learning more about HTML this semester.

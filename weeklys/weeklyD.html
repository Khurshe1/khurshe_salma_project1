        This week in Internet Art, I continued to work on my Project 1.
        I had trouble having the triangles continue to move while on the screen.
        Once a triangle is clicked upon, you are sent to another section of the webpage. 
        I still have to fix parts of the project this week.

        I had two midterms in my other classes this week. 
        I am looking forward to spring break coming up!
        For spring break, I will be going to Chicago for four days and will be spending the rest of the break relaxing with friends and family!
